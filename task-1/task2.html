                        <td>In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the document, window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.</td>
                        <td>From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language</td>
            </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality</td>
        <td>Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the application on</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Since JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web you are stuck with using older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.</td>
        <td>another difference is that Node.js supports both the CommonJS and ES module systems (since Node.js v12), while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.</td>
        </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>It also indicates which methods are available for different versions of Node.js</td>
        <td>HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.</tr>
